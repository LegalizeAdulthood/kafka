# Kafka

Contained herein is the source for kafka, which is a program that
translates BNF grammars into C programs to generate strings in the
grammar, and files for three useful kafka programs, insult, flame,
and babble. I don't have a manual page for kafka because I have
been too lazy to write one, but if you read the .k files you will
probably be able to figure out how things work. Any improvements
anybody can make on these programs I'd be happy to hear about. The
usual disclaimer: any opinions stated in the following code, or
statements produced by the included programs, have nothing to do
with U. C. Berkeley or anybody, including me...
